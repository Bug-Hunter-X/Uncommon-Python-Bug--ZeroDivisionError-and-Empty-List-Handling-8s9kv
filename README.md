This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The primary issue revolves around the handling of empty lists and potential floating-point inaccuracies.  The `bug.py` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.py` presents a robust and improved version that addresses these issues effectively.
